Java - Basic Console App - Week 08
5. In Chapter 8, you created a Salesperson class with fields for an ID number and sales
values. Now, create an application that allows you to store an array that acts as a
database of any number of Salesperson objects up to 20. While the user decides to
continue, offer three options: to add a record to the database, to delete a record from
the database, or to change a record in the database. Then proceed as follows:
If the user selects the add option, issue an error message if the database is full.
Otherwise, prompt the user for an ID number. If the ID number already exists in
the database, issue an error message. Otherwise, prompt the user for a sales value
and add the new record to the database.
If the user selects the delete option, issue an error message if the database is
empty. Otherwise, prompt the user for an ID number. If the ID number does not
exist, issue an error message. Otherwise, do not access the record for any future
processing.
If the user selects the change option, issue an error message if the database is
empty. Otherwise, prompt the user for an ID number. If the requested record
does not exist, issue an error message. Otherwise, prompt the user for a new
sales value and change the sales value for the record.
After each option executes, display the updated database in ascending order by
Salesperson ID number and prompt the user to select the next action. Save the
application as SalespersonDatabase.java.
