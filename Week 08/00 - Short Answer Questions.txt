* Week 8: Advanced Array Concepts


Every instance class:
==> like baking a cake, follow the recipe !
- add constant static fields for: threshold values, maximums, minimums, array sizes, etc
- add private instance fields
- Constructors - remember the "this" shortcut !
- Mutators
- Accessors
- toString
- any other methods you need

COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab
Week Eight

Question One Answer the following questions. Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.

(a) Describe how two-dimensional arrays represent a table of data.

2D - grid of rows and columns
table of data
a single 2D worksheet in spreadsheet


(b) What is the main difference between an Array and an ArrayList? Give an example.

Array VS ArrayList

imports ?

String[] names = new String [100];
ArrayList<String> namesAL = new ArrayList<String> ();

Array
	not resizable
	can contain primitive types and reference types
	use square brackets to declare
	Must know the size when you declare
	use [] to access elements - no methods ...
	arrayName.length for array size
	no imports needed

ArrayList
	dynamically resizable
	can only contain Reference types (objects)
	use ArrayList<datatype> to declare
	don't have to know the size when you declare
	use size(), add() and delete(), etc methods
	size(): number of items in the ArrayList
	Must import java.util.Arraylist

Andrew:
Arrays can contain primitive and objects but arraylists can only have objects?
Array lists use size(), add() and delete()
Have to import java.util.Arraylist

Byron:
arrayName.length? for array size



Question Two
a. Create a class called Dog which has two instance variables dogName as a string and dogAge as an integer.
b. Add a default constructor and a parameterised constructor.
c. Add get and set methods

d. Create another class in the same folder called Dogs, in Dogs create an array of three Dog objects
e. In the Dogs class's constructor populate the array (using new and the parameterised constructor) use: Fido, 3; Rover, 8 and Deefer, 2;
f. Create a main method in Dogs and create an object of type Dogs.
g. Create a method in Dogs displayDogs to display the three dogs.
h. Call the method displayDogs in the main using the Dogs object you have created in section f.


Question Three
a. Create a class called ArrayListTest within the main method create an ArrayList of strings called names
b. Add the names Tom, Dick and Harry to the ArrayList (in main)
c. Using the enhanced for loop print out these names (in main)
d. Remove Dick from the list and then add George.
e. Insert John into the beginning of the list
f. Use a traditional for loop (counter controlled) to print out the updated list
