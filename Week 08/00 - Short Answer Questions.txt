* Week 8: Advanced Array Concepts


Every instance class:
It's like baking a cake, follow the recipe !
- add constant static fields for: threshold values, maximums, minimums, etc
- add private instance fields
- Constructors - remember the "this" shortcut !
- Mutators
- Accessors
- toString
- any other methods you need



COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab
Week Eight

Question One Answer the following questions. Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.

(a) Describe how two-dimensional arrays represent a table of data.

(b) What is the main difference between an Array and an ArrayList? Give an example.


Question Two
a. Create a class called Dog which has two instance variables dogName as a string and dogAge as an integer.
b. Add a default constructor and a parameterised constructor.
c. Add get and set methods
d. Create another class in the same folder called Dogs, in Dogs create an array of three Dog objects
e. In the Dogs class's constructor populate the array (using new and the parameterised constructor) use: Fido, 3; Rover, 8 and Deefer, 2;
f. Create a main method in Dogs and create an object of type Dogs.
g. Create a method in Dogs displayDogs to display the three dogs.
h. Call the method displayDogs in the main using the Dogs object you have created in section f.
Mike O's extensions:
-> Dog class: add toString()
-> Dogs class: change Array -> ArrayList
-> Dogs class: add methods: add (String, int), get (String), search (String), remove (String), ...
-> Move main to DogsTester class: a 3 class project !
-> Almost a mini-database !  (Add saveToFile, loadFromFile, etc and almost there !)
-> Demo re-use - if we changed Console App to a GUI App, Web App, etc.


Question Three
a. Create a class called ArrayListTest within the main method create an ArrayList of strings called names
b. Add the names Tom, Dick and Harry to the ArrayList (in main)
c. Using the enhanced for loop print out these names (in main)
d. Remove Dick from the list and then add George.
e. Insert John into the beginning of the list
f. Use a traditional for loop (counter controlled) to print out the updated list
