b. Write a for loop which traverses the array and outputs the numbers on a line separated by spaces

c. Write an enhanced for loop which does the same as part b.

d. Write a loop which adds the values in the array and also finds the minimum and maximum.

e. Write a method which will accept the array as a parameter and an integer (key) as a parameter, the method will search the array for the key value and will return the index of the found value or -1 if the value is not found. Write code to test it.
