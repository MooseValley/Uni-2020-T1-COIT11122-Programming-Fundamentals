Week 07 - Arrays

Quick recap / review:

int[] intsArray = new int[20];

final int MAX_SIZE = 20;
int[] intsArray = new int[MAX_SIZE];

intsArray[0] = 3;
intsArray[1] = 5;
intsArray[19] = 999;
intsArray[20] = 123; // ERROR: index out of bounds

String[] names = new String [30]; // 0 to 29,  null

Q. When you say [] anywhere means an array in java, does that also include
   public static void main(String[] args)

args.length
for (int k = 0; k < args.length; k++)
{
   S.o.p (args[k]);
}

java MyClass 123 "hello world" 4.567



Array of size N has: 0 ... (N-1)  index / storage locations.  Elements.

If you need the size of the array (how many elements / locations) use the length property:
arrayName.length

int[] daysPerMonth = {31, 28, 31}; // 3, 0 ... 2

String[] states = {"Qld", "NSW", "Vic"}; // 3: 0 ... 2

for (int k = 0; k < states.length; k++)
{
   S.o.p (states[k]);
}

for (int k = 0; k < states.length; k++)
{
   S.o.p ("Enter state: ");
   state[k] = kb.nextLine();
}

for (String s : states)
{
   S.o.p (s);
}

for (int val : daysPerMonth)
{
   S.o.p (val);
}

When you pass an array to a method you are passing the array reference - so the method has full access to the array - and can change, edit, corrupt the data.


See these examples from lecture:
* PassByValuePassByReference.java
* Employee.java

COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab Week Seven

Question One Answer the following questions. Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.

(a) What benefits does the enhanced for statement provide for array processing? What are its limitations?

for (int k = 0; k < states.length; k++)
{
   S.o.p ("State " + (k + 1) + ": " + states[k]);
}

// Enhanced For Loop / Compact For Loop / For Each Loop
int count = 0;
for (String s : states)
{
   count++;
   S.o.p ("State " + count + ": " + s);
}

Benefits:
* simpler code, less code
* guaranteed to loop through the whole array (unless you break out).

Limitations:
* cannot start part way through the array
* don't get auto access to a loop index
* you cannot go in reverse order through the array - only forwards


(b) What is an off-by-one error?

final int MAX_SIZE = 20;
int[] intsArray = new int[MAX_SIZE];

intsArray[0] = 3;
intsArray[1] = 5;
intsArray[19] = 999;
intsArray[20] = 123; // ERROR: index out of bounds

for (int k = 1; k <= states.length; k++) // 2 "off by 1 errors"
{
   S.o.p ("State " + (k + 1) + ": " + states[k]);
}


(c) Why are command-line arguments passed to the main method as Strings? What problems would arise if command-line arguments were passed using an array of doubles?

java MyClass {123.5, 33.45, 66.78}


args[0]: "{123.5,"
args[1]: "33.45,"
args[2]: "66.78}"

public class MyClass
{
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      for (int k = 0; k < args.length; k++)
      {
         System.out.println ("args[" + k + "]: " + args[k]);
      }
   }
}




Question Two

a. Declare and create an integer array called numbers with the following numbers in a class called MyArray 42, 56, 34, 27, 72, 12, 98, 85, 33, 67



b. Write a for loop which traverses the array and outputs the numbers on a line separated by spaces

c. Write an enhanced for loop which does the same as part b.

d. Write a loop which adds the values in the array and also finds the minimum and maximum.

e. Write a method which will accept the array as a parameter and an integer (key) as a parameter, the method will search the array for the key value and will return the index of the found value or -1 if the value is not found. Write code to test it.

	TwelveInts.java
	ArrayMethodDemo.java
	Salesperson.java

Array of objects


Class
* Constructors
* Accesssors
* Mutators
* toString

Array of that class and call all of the methods.

Derived / Calculated value
-> store it in the class unless it is changes / changing a lot
-> otherwise derive it whenever it is needed
-> how often is it going to be needed ?

For Ass 2 - it depends on the Ass 2 Spec.
