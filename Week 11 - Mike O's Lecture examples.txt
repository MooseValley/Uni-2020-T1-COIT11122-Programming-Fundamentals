Q. Hey Mike, Im really struggling with this java programming assignment and wanted to see if i would be able to have just 15 minutes of your time after our lecture today to ask a few questions or get some advice. This is my last assessment piece, and due to this being my first time ever doing coding i am incredibly stuck and have no idea whats wrong or how to fix it. I've tried to re-watch lectures and read textbooks to no avail.

Q. Mr.O'malley, about the assignment 2, what should be the maximum number of pizza a customer can order?
10


How to create a pizza
How to the array
How to check if there is still room in the array

"c:/java/Week 11/data/abc.dat"

System.out.println ("Hello");
System.err.println ("Error");

   // 2 options:
   // * keep reading until you no more data
   // * when you write the file, write the number of records count as the 1st line
   //   and then read that count in here to work out how long to loop.
