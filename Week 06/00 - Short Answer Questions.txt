Assigment 1 due tonight - Friday, 24 April 2020, 11:59 PM
* In Week 5 and 6, I sit with each student in class and check their assignments and see how things are going, see if there are any issues, etc.
* Not possible this term - thanks to Coronavirus.  :(
* Any issues ?
* Any questions ?
* I cannot help you on your assignment, but I can explore / work on similar topics for other problems.

Q. Hi mike, quick question about the assignment, would we get marked down for using try and catch in our program, since we didn't really cover it in weeks 1-5?

Exception Handling
try catch finally throw

"Feature Creep"

Q. How else would I validate an integer input, where the program would crash if I accidently input a letter?

Perfectly OK - program wil crash if user enters ABC instead of a number.


Q. cant we check if the input is a certain type of variable?
Ass 1 => no
We have done enough Java yet.

COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab Week Six

Question One

Answer the following questions. Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.

(a) What are overloaded methods?
methods with the same name that can accept a variety of inputs?
Also the context.

Java works out which method to call based on context, and the arguments passed to the method.

menu.add (menuitem);
arrayList.add ("Frankie");


Are methods with the same name which only differ in return type valid overloaded methods?
Examples


(b) Why do identifiers have scope?
What is an identifier ?

are identifiers the name we give a vairable
Field, variable, identifier ....
Constant = identifier as well
A name for something that contains data

What would happen if everything had GLOBAL / unlimited scope ?

Any data or method is accessible / changeable (data) / corruptible (data)
Disaster - wild west, anything goes, no rules, no integrity ==> CHAOS !






Question Two

a) Create a class Car which has two private instance variables: make (String) and price (double)

b) Create the following constructors:
A default constructor: make = null and price = 0.0
Parameterised constructors:
- Both make and price
- Only make initialised
- Only price initialised
(use the default values for the other variables)

c) Create get and set methods

d) Create a toString method which will return a string representing the make and price.

e) Create a main method within the Car class to instantiate objects of this class and to test all of the constructors and the get and set methods

	FormLetterWriter
	FitnessTracker
	Bread, Sandwich
	MathTest

Q. none of this is correct, but you can do it with shadowing between class variables and method variables right?


private String name;

public void ::::: (String name)
{
   // ERROR:
   int val = 45;
   int val = 34;

   // OK: separate, non-pverlapping blocks within a method.
   {
     int val = 45;
   }
   {
     int val = 34;
   }

}

7
Non ambigous, overloaded methods
Must have same name
Must have different ???
parameters: order and type

public void method (String, int)
public void method (int, String)
public void method (int)
public void method (String)
public void method ()

public int method (int) // OK ???  ERROR - ambigouse method

Q. Just a question, if the method accepts int and string, it would error if you input a double?

method ("Frankie", 3.45); // ERROR

method ("Frankie", (int) 3.45); // Typecasting.  :)
method ("Frankie", (int) Math.round(3.45) );


Q. okay, but the other way around it would promote the int to a double?
YES.  :)
