/*
5. a. Create a class for the Tip Top Bakery named Bread with data fields for bread type
(such as “rye”) and calories per slice. Include a constructor that takes parameters
for each field, and include get methods that return the values of the fields. Also
include a public final static String named MOTTO and initialize it to The staff of
life. Write an application named TestBread to instantiate three Bread objects with
different values, and then display all the data, including the motto, for each object.
Save both the Bread.java and TestBread.java files.

b. Create a class named SandwichFilling. Include a field for the filling type (such as
“egg salad”) and another for the calories in a serving. Include a constructor that takes
parameters for each field, and include get methods that return the values of the
fields. Write an application named TestSandwichFilling to instantiate three
SandwichFilling objects with different values, and then display all the data for each
object. Save both the SandwichFilling.java and TestSandwichFilling.java files.

c. Create a class named Sandwich. Include a Bread field and a SandwichFilling
field. Include a constructor that takes parameters for each field needed in the two
objects and assigns them to each object’s constructor.Write an application named
TestSandwich to instantiate three Sandwich objects with different values, and
then display all the data for each object, including the total calories in a Sandwich,
assuming that each Sandwich is made using two slices of Bread. Save both the
Sandwich.java and TestSandwich.java files.
