/*
3. a. Create a FitnessTracker class that includes data fields for a fitness activity, the
number of minutes spent participating, and the date. The class includes methods
to get each field. In addition, create a default constructor that automatically
sets the activity to “running,” the minutes to 0, and the date to January 1 of the
current year. Save the file as FitnessTracker.java. Create an application that
demonstrates eachmethod works correctly, and save it as TestFitnessTracker.java.

b. Create an additional overloaded constructor for the FitnessTracker class you
created in Exercise 3a. This constructor receives parameters for each of the data
fields and assigns them appropriately. Add any needed statements to the
TestFitnessTracker application to ensure that the overloaded constructor works
correctly, save it, and then test it.

c. Modify the FitnessTracker class so that the default constructor calls the threeparameter
constructor. Save the class as FitnessTracker2.java. Create an application
to test the new version of the class, and name it TestFitnessTracker2.java.
