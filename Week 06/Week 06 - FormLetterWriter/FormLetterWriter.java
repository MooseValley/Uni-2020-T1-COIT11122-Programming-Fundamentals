/*
1. Create a class named FormLetterWriter that includes two overloaded methods
named displaySalutation(). The first method takes one String parameter that
represents a customer’s last name, and it displays the salutation “Dear Mr. or Ms.”
followed by the last name. The second method accepts two String parameters that
represent a first and last name, and it displays the greeting “Dear” followed by the first
name, a space, and the last name. After each salutation, display the rest of a short
business letter: “Thank you for your recent order.” Write a main() method that tests
each overloaded method. Save the file as FormLetterWriter.java.
