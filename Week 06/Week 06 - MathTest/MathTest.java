/*
7. Write a Java application that uses the Math class to determine the answers for each of
the following:
a. The square root of 37
b. The sine and cosine of 300
c. The value of the floor, ceiling, and round of 22.8
d. The larger and the smaller of the character ‘D’ and the integer 71
e. A random number between 0 and 20 (Hint: The random() method returns a
value between 0 and 1; you want a number that is 20 times larger.)
Save the application as MathTest.java.
