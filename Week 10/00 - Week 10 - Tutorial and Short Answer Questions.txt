COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab Week Ten

Question One

Answer the following questions. Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.
(a) What is a string in Java?

(b) What is the use of a string? Give an example.

(c) List a string method which can compare two strings.


Question Two

For each of the given program segments, read the code, and write the output. Do not execute these programs on a computer.

(a) What is output by the following lines of code?

1 // CompareStrings.java
2
3 import java.util.Scanner;
4
5 public class CompareStrings
6 {
7     public static void main( String args[] )
8     {
9        // get two strings
10       String firstString = “Java”;
11       String secondString = “java”;
12       // compare two strings
13       int value = firstString.compareTo( secondString );
14
15       // display result
16       System.out.println( "\nCompare Result:" );
17
18       if ( value == 0 )
19          System.out.printf("%s == %s\n", firstString, secondString );
20       else if ( value > 0 )
21          System.out.printf( "%s > %s\n", firstString, secondString );
22       else
23          System.out.printf( "%s < %s\n", firstString, secondString );
24    } // end main
25 } // end class CompareStrings


(b) What is output by the following lines of code?
1 // Exercise Sentences.java
2
3 import java.util.Random;
4
5 public class Sentences
6 {
7     public static void main( String args[] )
8     {
9        String article[] = { "the ", "a ", "some ", "any " };
10       String noun[] = { "boy", "girl", "town", "car" };
11       String verb[] ={ " drove", " jumped", " ran", " walked"};
12       String preposition[] ={" to ", " from ", " over ", " under "};
13       // create sentence
14       for ( int j = 0; j < 2; j++ )
15       {
16          int article1 = j;
17          int noun1 = j;
18          int verb1 = j;
19          int preposition1 = j;
20          int article2 = j;
21          int noun2 = j+2;
22
23          StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();
24
25          // concatenate words and add period
26          buffer.append( article[ article1 ] + noun[ noun1 ] +
27          verb[ verb1 ] + preposition[ preposition1 ] +
28          article[ article2 ] + noun[ noun2 ] + ".\n" );
29
30          // capitalize first letter and display
31          buffer.setCharAt(
32             0, Character.toUpperCase( buffer.charAt( 0 ) ) );
33          System.out.println( buffer.toString() );
34       } // end for
35    } // end main
36 } // end class Sentences


Question Three
Modify the application in Exercise 2(a) so that it compares two strings input by the user. The application should output whether the first string is less than, equal to or greater than the second.


Question Four
Modify the application in Exercise 2(b) so that it generates and displays 10 random sentences. The application should use random number generator.


Question Five
Write an application that reads a line of text and prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet in the text.


Question Six
Write an application that reads a line of text and prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each different word in the text. The application should include the words in the table in the same order in which they appear in the text.

LectureGuiExample.java
Students TODO:
* Add validation of inputs - display error and return if error found.
* Move set default values code a method and call in Constructor as well.
* Neaten up the GUI (after this week's tutorial).


** Tutorial this week:
* "Slap a GUI" on the Dog, Dogs, DogTester classes -
so make sure you understand and are familiar with the code in these classes.
