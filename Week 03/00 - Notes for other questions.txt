COIT11222 Programming Fundamentals Tutorial/Lab Week Three

Question one

Answer the following questions.
Your answers should be concise; aim for two or three sentences.
(a) What does the if selection statement allow a program to do?

Conditions and branches.
Different paths / different processing depending the values of
data, date time,


(b) What is an import declaration and where does it appear in a Java source code file?

Why ?
	Bring in extra functionality
	Scanner, Date, JOptionPane
	GUI labels, buttons

Where ?
	before the public class

Comment header
imports
public class ...



(c) Why does a semicolon cause a logic error if placed immediately after the right parenthesis of an if statement?

if (age == 30); // Logic ERROR
{
   System.out.println ("You are 30");
}


Question two

For each program segment, read the code, and write the output.
Do not execute the programs on a computer.
What is output by the following program for each of the input values
5, 7, 100, -7 and 0?

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Output
{
	public static void main( String args[] )
	{
		int number;
		Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in );
		System.out.println( "Enter integer: " );
		number = input.nextInt();
		if ( number != 7 )
			System.out.print( "Welcome " );
		if ( ( number % 5 ) == 0 )
			System.out.println( "To Java Programming" );
	}
}

Welcome To Java Programming

0 % 5
5 goes into 0 0 times with 0 remainder



Question Three

Determine if there is are errors in this following program segment.
If there is an error, specify whether it is a logic error or a compilation error,
specify the line number in the program and write the corrected code.
If the code does not contain an error, write "no error.”
There may be more than one error in the program segment.

1: int q = 100;
2:
3: System.out.print("q is");
4:
5: if (q = 100)
6: System.out.print("equal to 100");
7: if (q ! 100);
8: System.out.print( "not equal to 100");

Compilation error ! -> != and logic error - semi-colon at end.
7: if (q != 100)

Compilation = -> ==
5: if (q == 100)
