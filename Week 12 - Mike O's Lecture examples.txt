Q. I wanted to create a program which would allow me to store the name of a band, name of the song and song duration. I also wanted to place in a Tap Tempo. Where you could tap the spacebar along with the beat of the song. The program would save the time between each tap and divide by the amount of elements placed into the array to find the beats per minute. I would also be able to display all songs, search songs by name or bpm, sort, etc. I was wondering if this would be okay, and if that would be possible and within the scope of what we’ve learned so far?

Start Tempo
 set counter to 0
 get datetime
Stop Tempo
 get datetime
 work out seconds
 work out bpm
Click: Click a button repeatedly
-> add 1 to a count

LocalDateTime
DateTime


Q. Are we allowed to use the functions of Java which we haven't learned?

A. Only limited, within reason
Don't go way beyond what we have learnt.
Limited time - focus on other exams as well
LocalDateTime
DateTime


Q. Are we allowed to use GUI Builder applications to help build the GUI or are we required to build it manually?
GUI Builders (Netbeans)
-> produce horrible code.
-> pollute your beautiful code with horrible code
-> Build the GUI manually


Q. In future courses do we learn about using API's to access data for our programs?
JSON
Web Apis
SQL Server
Mongo DB
MySQL
XML

Encapsulation
Overloading
Polymorphism
Inherritance
OOP // OOD

Project Work
* Database courses: Elizabeth Tansley, Access, SQL Server
* Connecting Java to SQL Server

Could could not teach you everything
We might have covered all of Java ...

Software Development / Computer programming
-> life-time of learning
-> life-time of challenge


Q. What would be helpful to me I think would be if we could spend some time covering developing the spec. After the tap-tap if you like...

Systems Analysis and Design
User specs, ...
Everybody hated
woffly, vague, so much buzzwords ...

"I absolutely despise systems analysis".
"Super Boring"
"OMG I hate this class"
everyone in my class of 1984.


Analysis
* ask / explore every relevant question
* document all relevant information / answers in concise, clear notes / diagrams

Design
Development
Testing

Analysis / Business analysts / Systems Analysts
* Trend: should not be programmers
* Disater
* Unless you go through the whole Systems Dev lifecycle a few times, you will not know what questions to ask, or how important it is to turn over every stone, and open every pandora's box / can of worms, this question is going to start fights ... I don't want to ask it. These are These are the questions you REALLY need to ask.



Spec

Spec

The Analysis Spec
Rocky DVD Store needs a new application to store their DVD rentals.
Inputs:
* Renter name
* Rented date/time
* cost per night
* type of rental: classic movies, latest releases, etc
* different prices based on type of rental ?
* Number of nights rented
* Scheduled Return date/time

Story board in power point or similar
Screen shots of your app

Validation Rules:
 Renter name cannot be blank
 cost / night must be >= 2.50

Late Fees Rules:
  if returned after scheduled Return date/time
  Late fees = extra hours * $1.25

GUI
  Screen shot
Display late returners report

Spec length
2-3 pages + title page
Not 20+ pages.

Q. Unrelated question to the assignments and stuff. But I was just wondering if you have elective suggestions for someone who wants to heavily focus on programming. I found coding fundamentals, but I wasn't sure what then even covers.
