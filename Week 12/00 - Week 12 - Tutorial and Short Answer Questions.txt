Week 12 Revision


Exam Alternative:
	Week 4 / Ass 1 level at least
	GUI, plus more = bonus marks
	couple of radio buttons
	checkboxes
	combobox
	textfield
	buttons: add, display all, clear, exit ...

Don't do / Don't go overboard:
	Graphs = NO
	Multiple JFrames in their project = NO
	Keep it simple.  1 GUI class and 1 data class
	Don't worry about arrays / arraylists (unless you want to)
	Just do the basics plus a GUI if you want the bonus marks.


Q. I started writing my program yesterday and went down a few rabbit holes
Trying to put too much in

Feature creep / trying to do too much !  A real TRAP.


Q. I have main GUI class, one other GUI class to open a metronome feature and data-class, I simplified it a bit.

JTabbedPane tabs = new JTabbedPane ();

tabs.add (myPanel,      "Main", ....);
tabs.add (mySetupPanel, "Settings", ....);

==> but even this is way way too much.

Put everything in one single JFrame ...  one GUI class.


Q. I also have another issue where I'm using Thread.sleep(interval); to create a beeping sound according to the BPM. But it's causing the program to hang.


      try
      {
         Thread.sleep (50); // Pause for 50 milliseconds.
      }
      catch (InterruptedException e)
      {
      }


		try
		{
			/*
			int bpm = Integer.parseInt(bpmField.getText());
			int interval = 60000 / bpm;

			while(play == true)
			{
				java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep();
				Thread.sleep(interval);
				System.out.println("Beep!");
			}
			*/

			java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep();
			System.out.println("Beep!");
		}

		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			//System.out.println("Beep!");
		}
}

Q. it works correctly, it just causes issues with the buttons
A. the sleep is also sleeping the UI - all in one thread.

Time bptTimer;

private void startSleeper(int bpm)
{
	bptTimer = new Timer (60000 / bpm, event -> sleeper() );
	bptTimer.start();
}

private void stopSleeper()
{
	if (bptTimer != null)
		bptTimer.stop();
}

private void sleeper()
{
	java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep();
	System.out.println("Beep!");
}


Any issues - remove the metronome ticking.
Interesting project.



==> I think I can handle it, I like the challenge



Exams
	Don't get exams back
	Tick or cross
	RTQ
	DNAQ



Q. If no one else has questions, I have more to throw lmao


File I/O
GUI


Q. How to have a 2nd GUI appear within the window of the main GUI similar to how a showMessageDialong would by using this.whatever

MainGUI
SubGUI

Pseudo Code:
	Way more complex than we want to this little project
	MainGUI.getLocation().getX() + (MainGUI.getWidth() - SubGUI.getWidth() / 2



Student Moodle
	Portfolios
	Ass 2 + this project - you came up with the idea, you wrote the spec,
	you wrote the evaluation guide, and you wrote all the code.


Questions about anything ?
Want me to go over anything ?



Q. I'm not sure this this is too complex either, but what about a radio button which would appear beside each entry that appears into the text area.


A. Damn everything that's cool is just a little too complex, RIP ):


JTable
columns
headings
type of data in each cell.


Q. ComboBox inside a JOptionPane / swing dialog

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( FlightManager.this, desPortsComboBox, "Select destination Airport", JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE);


Create a 2nd Combobox and use that for the Dialog and read it to synchronise or whatever:

   private void selectPlane()
   {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( LectureGuiExample.this, planeTypeDialogComboBox, "Select destination Airport", JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE);
      System.out.println ("Selected: " + planeTypeDialogComboBox.getSelectedItem() );

      planeTypeComboBox.setSelectedItem(planeTypeDialogComboBox.getSelectedItem() );
   }

===> Way, way, way more than is needed for the Alternate Exam.


Q. I'm actually looking to do something similar with the comboboxes, but I'm struggling to retrieve the information from the array which is in my main class

JFrame with combo

// Main GUI Class
private void displayGUI ()
{
   // Setup the Combobox, ....
   otherGUI.setupComboBox (array);

   // Display the other GUI .... dialog .. .whatever
   otherGui.show(); // setVisible ...
}


// otherGUI class:

public void setupComboBox (Planes[] array)
{
   myComboBox.removeAllItems();

   for (int k = 0 ; ...... )
   {
       myComboBox.addItem (array[k].getPlaneName() );
   }
}


===> Way, way, way more than is needed for the Alternate Exam.

Ass

Reduce.  Reduce.  :)  Think something about the level of Ass 1 Week 4 with a GUI - to get the bonus marks.  (That's what the spec says).

Simplify.  Reduce.  3 or 4 inputs - 1 textfield, a couple of radiobuttons, a JComboBox, ...  and some simple calculations / processing and a TextArea for output - add, clear, display all, exit buttons ... maybe a sort if you want.

Get it done.
Add the bells and whistles LATER ... during mid-term break, during next term, etc.

OMG !!!!
You're HIRED !!!!



Q. If no one else has anything, I was hoping you could give us some topics to do extra reading on before the next term?

Database: SQL
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE Name = 'Mike'
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE Name LIKE 'M%'

Java next term ....
try not to let your skills rust too much ....
Take a look at some Java to keep your mind refreshed

Think about what you want to do ... study ...

Ass 1
Ass 2
They might have all seemed hard, look back and them, try and do Ass 1 now, and see how easy it is.
You have come a long way.
Well done !
Your hard work has paid off !!

(2). Very special thanks to Wayne, Jarrod, Sangin, Byron.
For joining in and making the classes so much more interesting.

(3). Good luck with your future studies and future careers.
Find what you love doing ...
make that your career ...
