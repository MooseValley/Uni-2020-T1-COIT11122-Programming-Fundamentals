* Sorting,
* 2D, 3D, 4D, ... arrays,
* Rectangular VS Ragged arrays,
* Arrays class,
* ArrayList class,
* Enums (Enumerated types),

THIS WEEK:
* Week 9 : Introduction to Swing Components
* COIT11222_Week9.ppt
* GUI Programming

Batch Programming / Console Apps
* What we have been doing until today.
* program runs until the end - sequence of instructions,
* Program had full control.
* User really has no control of what happens next.
* If a user enters an invalid input, you display an error and ask them again (loop),
before moving on to the next input.

Event Driven Programming / GUI Programming
* User Driven programming
* Program sits there doing nothing until the user clicks a button, or a menu, or some event
fires off (1st day of month processing or whatever).
* User has full control over what happens next - they decide which button / menu / etc to click.
(For out programs anyway).
* If a user enters an invalid input, you display an error and stop - wait for the user to chose another action (button, menu, whatever).


AWT
	Abstract Windowed Toolkit
	basic set GUI components, few options,
Swing
	More components, more options, better look and feel, etc
	Still some AWT stuff
JavaFX
	More again ... Charts, Graphs, ....
	Looks like it is slowly being phased out by Oracle.


*************************************************************
LayoutManagers
*************************************************************
FlowLayout
	like words on a page
BorderLayout
	5 regions: North, South, East, West, Center
	Default LM for JFrame
GridLayout
	Grid of rows and columns
BoxLayout
GridBagLayout



Q. for borderlayout wouldn't you need to group the three labels into a single Frame/group to get them to show in the same region
im just guessing from the way it works in Python's Tkinter module


LectureGuiExample.java
Students TODO:
* Add validation of inputs - display error and return if error found.
* Move set default values code a method and call in Constructor as well.
* Neaten up the GUI (after this week's tutorial).



** Tutorial this week:
* We are going to "Slap a GUI" on the Dog, Dogs, DogTester classes -
so make sure you understand and are familiar with the code in these classes.
