*** "BAD" Comments:

// Create integer count and initialise to 0.
int count = 0;

// Loop from 1 to 10 inclusive, increment 1
for (count = 1; count <= 10; count++)
{
   // Output count to console screen followed by a comma.
   System.out.println (count + ", ");
}

*** "GOOD" Comments:

// Output 1, 2, 3, ... 10 to the console screen.
int count = 0;

for (count = 1; count <= 10; count++)
{
   System.out.print (count + ", ");
}
