Java - Basic Console App - Week 09
6. Design an application for a pizzeria. The user makes pizza order choices from list
boxes, and the application displays the price. The user can choose a pizza size of small
($7), medium ($9), large ($11), or extra large ($14), and one of any number of
toppings. There is no additional charge for cheese, but any other topping adds $1 to
the base price. Offer at least five different topping choices. Save the file as JPizza.java.
